# This class connects to rocbot.sqlite and uses a view to query. The returned 
# data is put into an object where methods run uses this info to generate a
# title, image url, and description which contains emojis. The emoji function 
# uses the Bot instance to perform a lookup which is why it's passed through.
# Because Discord doesn't allow non alpha characters in emojis there's a 
# santise function that strips unwanted characters which is also used on the 
# url formatting function. That's technical debt from when this was orignally
# using json files instead of sqlite and the sub context of the query and name 
# was used as the name to find image files so they had to match. This isn't the 
# case anymore and might be better to edit the image names now.
